## SurfaceMapperGUI

Projection mapping interface using Processing's SurfaceMapper and ControlP5 libraries

### Features
1. Create new surfaces (straight-edged quads or curved-edged bezier surfaces).
2. Load and save layouts.
3. Switch back and forth between rendering and calibrating.
4. Alter the resolution of the surfaces.
5. Alter the horizontal and vertical “force” on the edges of bezier surfaces.
6. Anchor points that are moved close to each other will snap together.
7. Assign pictures or videos as textures to any surface.
